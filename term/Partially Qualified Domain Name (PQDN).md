# Partially Qualified Domain Name (PQDN)
## Intro
Partially Qualified Domain Name (PQDN) refers the host name of `FQDN` (i.e. on the left-most label).

## Rule
Since PQDN refers the host name of `FQDN` (i.e. on the left-most label), the rule of PQDN is same as label.

Thus, each `labels` must 

+ consist of one or many `digit` (i.e. `0` to `9`), `uppercase letter` (i.e. `A` to `Z`), `lowercase letter` (`a` to `z`), and `hypen` (i.e. `-`).
+ start with an `uppercase letter` or `lowercase letter`
