# Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
## Intro
A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also referred to as an absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity in terms of DNS zone location in the hierarchy of DNS labels: it can be interpreted only in one way.

## Rule
Each `identifier` must 

+ consist of one or many `digit` (i.e. `0` to `9`), `uppercase letter` (i.e. `A` to `Z`), `lowercase letter` (`a` to `z`), and `hypen` (i.e. `-`).
+ start with an `uppercase letter` or `lowercase letter`

Here, each word is an `identifier`.

FQDN consist of many `words`, each word is seperated by delimiter `.`.
