# Search Query language
## Why do we have to learn it?
Since it is important for every user (even if you NEVER write code) and it is widely used. (See following usage section.)

## Usage
When one has to query search box, one uses search query language (as a person who NEVER learn about code may NOT know one uses, in fact we use it every day once we search things on the Internet). Including

+ Search thing on Explorer (such as Google Chrome).
+ Search thing on issuetracker (a kind of Google issue report website).

Now, I believe that every reader the first item is always used. 

That's the reason why I think everyone has to learn search query language. And that's the main purpose to wrote this article for me.

But don't worry about it. I will try to make it as easy as I can.
