# Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
## Intro
In computing Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection.

In email handling, IMAP is an application layer Internet protocol that allows an e-mail client to access email on a remote mail server.

IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them.

## Defined 
IMAP is defined by RFC 9051.

## Well-known port 
IMAP listens on port `143` by default.

## History
IMAP was designed by Mark Crispin in 1986 as a remote access mailbox protocol.

### IMAP1
IMAP1 was implemented as a `Xerox Lisp Machine client` and a `TOPS-20 server`.

### IMAP2
IMAP2 was defined in RFC 1064 (in 1988 year) and

it was updated by RFC 1176 (in 1990 year).

### IMAP3
IMAP2 was defined in RFC 1203 (in 1991 year).

### IMAP2bis
With the advent of MIME, IMAP2 was extended to support MIME body structures and add mailbox management functionality (create, delete, rename, message upload) that was absent from IMAP2.

### IMAP4
IMAP4 was formed in early 1990.

**NOTES**

The IMAP WG decided to rename IMAP2bis to IMAP4 to avoid confusion.
