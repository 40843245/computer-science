# Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
## Intro
In computing Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection.

In email handling, IMAP is an application layer Internet protocol that allows an e-mail client to access email on a remote mail server.

IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them.

## Defined 
IMAP is defined by RFC 9051.

## Well-known port 
IMAP listens on port `143` by default.
