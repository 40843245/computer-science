# singleton 
## Requirements
A Singleton candidate must satisfy three requirements:

1. controls concurrent access to a shared resource.
2. access to the resource will be requested from multiple, disparate parts of the system.
there can be only one object.
3.If your proposed Singleton has only one or two of these requirements, a redesign is almost always the correct option.
